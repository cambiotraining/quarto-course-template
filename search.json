    "text": "1.4 File Organisation\nThere are three things that you may edit:\n\nFiles in materials/ - this contains all the markdown/notebook files with the written materials (rendered on the site).\nFiles in course_files/ - this contains the files that participants will have on their training machines.\nThe index.md file - this is the homepage for the course.\n\n\n1.4.1 Course Materials\nThe materials can be written as plain markdown .md, Rmarkdown .Rmd, Quarto markdown .qmd or Jupyter notebooks .ipynb. As mentioned in Setup, if you are using Jupyter Notebooks, make sure to use Jupytext to have paired .ipynb/.qmd files.\nThe following conventions should be used:\n\nPlease name your files with a two-digit numeric prefix. For example 01-first_lesson.md. Use relatively descriptive names for the files (unlike this example!).\nAlways include the following YAML header, at the top of each file:\n---\ntitle: Lesson Title # keep this concise\n---\nThis title will appear both on the navigation bar on the left and as the title of the page. For example, the page you are viewing now has title: Course Rendering.\nOptionally, you can organise your files into sub-directories, if they are all part of a logical section of materials. This is up to personal preference. For example:\ncourse_folder\n  |_ materials\n        |_ section1\n        |    |_ 01-first_lesson_in_section1.md\n        |    |_ 02-second_lesson_in_section1.md\n        |_ section2\n             |_ 01-first_lesson_in_section2.md\n             |_ 02-second_lesson_in_section2.md\nIf you want to create slides using Quarto (documentation), please include them in a directory materials/&lt;section_folder&gt;/slides/.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Course Files & Data\nWhen we run a workshop, participants will have all the necessary files for the course on the training computers.\nGenerally, there are two types of files we may want to distribute to the participants:\n\nscripts - any scripts for exercises or examples we want to run interactively during the course.\ndata - any data files (CSV, FASTQ, etc.) that are used.\n\nThese course files should be in a directory called course_files and specify all the paths in the materials relative to that. So, this will be the directory structure you end up with:\ntop_level_course_directory\n  |_ course_files\n  |     |_ data\n  |     |_ scripts\n  |_ materials\n        |_ ... Markdowns as detailed earlier\nAs you develop the materials and identify suitable data for the workshop, you can place it in the directory course_files/data/ (within that you can set any directory structure you want) and scripts for the participants in course_files/scripts (again you can organise this in any way you think is useful).\nHowever, as a rule, only scripts should be pushed to the repository.\nGenerally, we do not keep data in the repository, unless the files are text-based and/or small. We keep the data files on our Dropbox, so anyone can download them from a stable link (including with wget/curl).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipFlexible course file structure\n\n\n\nWhat’s given here is our recommended convention but, if you think your course files would benefit from a different file structure, please let us know.\nEqually, if you don’t need to distribute scripts or data with your course (e.g. if your course is live-coded and data is downloaded from a public URL), then leave these directories empty as they are.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Homepage\nThe index.md file (at the root of the directory) will become the homepage for the course.\nThis file can be edited towards the end of the material development, following the instructions given there. You can see an example on the homepage of this website.",

    "text": "2.5 Exercises\nBy convention, we include exercises at the end of each chapter under a level 2 header named “Exercises”. This makes it easier to navigate to from the table of contents on the right, which is useful during a workshop. Within this section we then include one or more exercises using the bespoke :::{.callout-exercise} and make use of a collapsible callout box to make the answers hidden by default.\nHere is an example of how the exercise should look at the end (the answers show the syntax skeleton for an exercise).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExerciseExercise 1 - Write an exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we use to write an answer to the exercise?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswerAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the bespoke .callout-answer, which is collapsed by default. Here is a code snippet for a full exercise:\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n### Short Description\n\nQuestion here.\n\n::: {.callout-answer}\nAnswer here.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExerciseExercise 2 - Exercise levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel: \nWe optionally use a star system to define the difficulty level of an exercise (for example this exercise was marked as level 2).\nThe answer shows you how to add these stars.\nThe home page page of the course gives a description of the 3 levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswerAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provide a shortcode in the form {{&lt; level X &gt;}} where X is the number of filled stars (1, 2 or 3). You can add this after the exercise title, like so:\n::: {.callout-exercise}\n### Short Description\n{{&lt; level 2 &gt;}}\n\nQuestion here.\n\n::: {.callout-answer}\nAnswer here.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExerciseExercise 3 - Hints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it may be useful to add hints to the exercises. How is this done?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHintHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf for exercises we had .callout-exercise and for answers we had .callout-answer, for hints we have…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswerAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou guessed it, you can use .callout-hint (the box is also collapsed by default):\n:::{.callout-hint}\nHint(s) here.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Configuring exercises\nThere are a few ways to customise how exercises are rendered.\n\nExercise numbering\nBy default, exercises are numbered within each section. You can set this option from the _quarto.yml file, for example to turn it off:\nexercises: \n  number: false\n\n\nHide all answers\nBy default answers are rendered on the site. If you want avoid them from being rendered at all (e.g. during a course) you can edit the _quarto.yml file and turn this on:\nexercises: \n  hide-answers: true\n\n\nHide individual answers\nYou can stop individual answers from being rendered using an attribute to the answer callout:\n\n{.callout-answer hide = true} will hide (i.e. not render) the answer\n{.callout-answer hide = false} will show (i.e. render) the answer\n\nNote that these options overide the global option set in the _quarto.yml detailed above.\n\n\nCross-reference exercises\nIn the exercise callout, you can set an id with prefix #ex- and then cross-reference it in the text using the handle @ex-. For example, this syntax::\n:::{.callout-exercise #ex-demo}\nAn exercise demo.\n:::\n\nSomewhere in the text, I want to reference @ex-demo.\nWill render as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExerciseExercise 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn exercise demo.\n\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the text, I want to reference Exercise 4.",

For example if you used #fig-unix-terminal you could reference it as @fig-unix-terminal (see example below).\nThe alternative text is for accessibility purposes and should include a short description of what the image portrais (e.g. for individuals using a screen reader).\n\nThere are more advanced figure layouts possible, see the Quarto Figures documentation to learn more.\nHere is the code generating Figure 2.1:\n![The Unix logo.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/UNIX_logo.svg/250px-UNIX_logo.svg.png){#fig-unix-terminal fig-alt=\"The word 'Unix' appears on the logo in green, with text under it saying 'An Open Group Standard'\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Unix logo.\n\n\n\nFor image files, we encourage you to do things in this order:\n\nIf the image is available online (e.g. HTML of a paper) link to the URL of the image rather thank keep a copy in the repository. Make sure to link to the image source in the figure legend.\nIf it’s a diagram, use a program such as Inkscape to produce a SVG file (these are easier to edit in the future).\nOtherwise save the figure as a PNG (e.g. software screenshots).\n\nFor saving and naming images:\n\nSave images in materials/&lt;section_folder&gt;/images (if your materials don’t have higher-level sections save it in materials/images).\n\nUse short, but descriptive, names for your images.\nConsider adding a common prefix to all images from a particular lesson file. For example rstudio_interface.png and rstudio_new_project.png could be used to name images in a lesson explaining how to use the RStudio IDE.",

Some of these roles may be slightly redundant, but they should give enough choice to capture the diversity of contributions to our materials. We may revise this list from time to time.\n\nConceptualisation: Contributes original ideas to the course design and content. This includes proposing new topics, suggesting overall structure for the materials and clarifying key concepts.\nAuthoring: Writes substantative content by drafting new sections or significantly revising existing materials. This includes research, outlining, and drafting sections in detail.\nEditing: Revises the content to improve clarity, flow and consistency. This includes providing suggestions or directly making changes to improve the quality of the writing.\nProofreading: Focuses on surface-level corrections. This includes grammar, spelling and formatting errors.\nData curation: Finds, prepares, and tests datasets for use in demonstrations or exercises. This includes ensuring that the data is suitable for the course content and manageable within the constraints of a live course.\nCoding: Develops code or scripts used in the course. This includes creating examples for teaching or writing scripts that the students use for exercises.\nSoftware setup: Determines and/or tests software requirements for the course and writes documentation or scripts to recreate the environment. This can be used by the computing officer for setting up training environments and by the participants to recreate the environment on their own computers after the course.\nScientific review: Domain expert who evaluates the accuracy and completeness of the materials.\nPedagogical review: Reviews the training materials focusing on pedagogy and teaching effectiveness. Ensures that the learning objectives align with the content and exercises and are suitable for the target audience.\nProject coordination: Oversees the writing project, ensuring timelines, roles, and objectives are met.\n\nIf these feel limiting, it may be worth also looking at the list given on the All Contributors project.",
