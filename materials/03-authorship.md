## Being an author

We welcome contributions to our course materials. 
If your contributions become substantial, you may be added as an author. 
We currently have no hard rule about what constitues sufficient work for an authorship.
If you think you should be an author on one of our courses, please get in touch. 

We also acknowledge smaller contributions under the Acknowledgements section of the course front page.


## Citation

We use the [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) to keep information about authorship in our materials. 
Although this format is primarily designed for software and data, we adopted it [following The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/07/lesson-cffs/) training community. 

Each repository has a `CITATION.cff` file, which is used to automatically populate the course front page with citation format and author information. 


## Author roles

Unfortunately, at the present the CFF format schema does not allow adding an author "role" ([see here](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/112)). 
As a workaround, we use the author `alias` entry to record this information. 

We don't have a formal **ontology for author roles**, although we take inspiration from [CRT](https://credit.niso.org/contributor-roles-defined/) and [DataCite](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/contributorType/). 

We use the author `website` entry to indicate **corresponding authors**.
